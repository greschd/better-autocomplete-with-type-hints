# Better Autocomplete with Type Hints

This is a simple example of how type hints can improve the autocomplete experience.

The file ``no_typehints.py`` shows the code without type hints, whereas they are present in ``with_typehints.py``.

The code was shown in my lighting talk at the Swiss Python Summit 2024, whose slides are also available in this repository. A recording will soon be available [on the Python Summit website](https://www.python-summit.ch/recordings/).
